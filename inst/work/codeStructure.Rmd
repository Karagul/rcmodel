Issue: makePredData has to return different columns depending on the type of model. 

- makeModelData and makePredData should always return the requisite columns for the model to be calibrated / make predictions.
- makeModelData doesn't us a model, and makes transformations of expected columns:
    - Date --> doy, time
    - flow --> q
    - conc --> c
    - other columns preserved.
- makePredData uses a model argument, should always return the columns needed to make predictions
    - Date (rclm)
    - doy, time (rcgam)
    - q
    - c
    - other columns as needed in model
