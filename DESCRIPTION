Description: Contains functions for the log-concentration (or load) vs log-flow
  family of regression models commonly referred to as "rating curves" in hydrology.
  Traditional linear regression models as well as more flexible general additive
  models a la Wang et al., 2011 are implemented. Automatic model selection similar
  to the LOADEST USGS FORTRAN program is also implemented.
