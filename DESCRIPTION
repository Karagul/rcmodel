Description: Contains functions for the log-concentration (or load) vs log-
    flow family of regression models commonly referred to as "rating curves"
    in hydrology. Traditional linear regression models as well as more flexible
    general additive models a la Wang et al., 2011 are implemented. Automatic model
    selection similar to the LOADEST USGS FORTRAN program is also implemented.
